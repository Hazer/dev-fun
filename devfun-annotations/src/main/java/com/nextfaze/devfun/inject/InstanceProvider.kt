/**
 * Provides object instances for one or more types.
 *
 * A rudimentary form of dependency injection is used throughout all of DevFun (not just for user-code function
 * invocation, but also between modules, definition and item processing, and anywhere else an object of some type is
 * desired - in general nothing in DevFun is static (except for the occasional `object`, but even then that is usually
 * an implementation and uses DI).
 *
 * This process is facilitated by various instance providers - most of which is described at the wiki entry on
 * [Dependency Injection](https://nextfaze.github.io/dev-fun/wiki/-dependency%20-injection.html).
 *
 * To quickly and simply provide a single object type, use [captureInstance] or [singletonInstance], which creates a
 * [CapturingInstanceProvider] that can be added to the root (composite) instance provider at `DevFun.instanceProviders`.
 * e.g.
 * ```kotlin
 * class SomeType : BaseType
 *
 * val provider = captureInstance { someObject.someType } // triggers for SomeType or BaseType
 * val singleInstance = singletonInstance { SomeType() } // triggers for SomeType or BaseType (result of invocation is saved)
 * ```
 *
 * If you want to reduce the type range then specify its base type manually:
 * ```kotlin
 * val provider = captureInstance<BaseType> { someObject.someType } // triggers only for BaseType
 * ```
 *
 * _Be aware of leaks! The lambda could implicitly hold a local `this` reference._
 *
