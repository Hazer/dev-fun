# DeveloperReference

`interface DeveloperReference` [(source)](https://github.com/NextFaze/dev-fun/tree/master/devfun-annotations/src/main/java/com/nextfaze/devfun/core/Definitions.kt#L163)

Defines references to annotations that are annotated by meta annotation [DeveloperAnnotation](../../com.nextfaze.devfun.annotations/-developer-annotation/index.md).

Developer Annotation annotations will be noted by DevFun and wrapped by this interface.
An example of this is used by the `devfun-inject-dagger2` module.

*At present the scope of references is limited to only `ExecutableElement` but is likely to increase as needed (feel free to make an issue or PR).*

**This is an experimental feature and subject to change. External input/suggestions welcome.**
