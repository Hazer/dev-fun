`DeveloperReference()`

Annotated elements will be recorded by DevFun for later retrieval via `devFun.developerReferences<DeveloperReference>()`.

In general this is not used much beyond testing.

Typically usage of this type is via your own custom annotations with [DeveloperAnnotation](../../com.nextfaze.devfun/-developer-annotation/index.md) Ã  la [DeveloperLogger](../-developer-logger/index.md).
